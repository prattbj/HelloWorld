# Overview

I am becoming a software engineer in order to learn how to build things like video games and music programs (digital synthesizers, fx plugins, etc..). 

This program is a simple Hello World program.

It was created so that I have a personal portfolio on GitHub.

# Development Environment

I used VS 2022 and wrote this in C++, since that is the language I will likely be using the most in my desired field.
